## ðŸ“¦ Installation

To get started with Manim, follow the installation instructions provided in the official Manim documentation:

- [Manim Community Edition Installation Guide](https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/installation.html)

This guide covers various installation methods, including using pip, conda, and Docker.

## ðŸ§ª Usage

After installing Manim, you can render animations by running Python scripts that define scenes. Each scene is a class that inherits from `Scene` and contains a `construct` method where animations are defined.

For example, a simple scene might look like this:

```python
from manim import *

class SquareToCircle(Scene):
    def construct(self):
        square = Square()
        self.play(Create(square))
        self.play(Transform(square, Circle()))
        self.play(FadeOut(square))
```

To render this scene, save the code in a file (e.g., `square_to_circle.py`) and run:

```bash
manim -pql square_to_circle.py SquareToCircle
```

This command renders the `SquareToCircle` scene at low quality and previews the output.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

The repository currently contains the following directories and files:

```
manim/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/                 # Source code for animations
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore           # Git ignore file
â””â”€â”€ README.md            # Project documentation
```

The `src/` directory is where your Manim scenes are defined.
